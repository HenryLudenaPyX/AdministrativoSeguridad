## Recommendations:

### 1. Technical and Physical Controls:
*Implement Principle of Least Privilege:*

Limit employee access to only the resources they need for their tasks, limiting unauthorized access.

*Develop and implement Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP):*

Enable the organization to recover quickly from critical incidents, minimizing downtime.

*Establish strong password policies:*

Require complex passwords, with periodic renewal and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

*Separation of duties:* 

Don't concentrate all tasks on one or more employees; instead, divide them. This way, in the event of a user theft, the attacker has fewer privileges.

*Install Intrusion Detection System (IDS):* 

To detect unauthorized access

*Establish a periodic backup system:*

Ensure availability after possible attacks or system failures.

*Adopt a password management system:*

Reduce human errors such as forgotten passwords through a credential management system.

*Modernize legacy systems:*

Replace manual monitoring with automated tools that detect incidents in real time.

### 2. Regulatory Compliance

*Control access to credit card information:*

Only authorized personnel should have access

*Securing the card processing environment:*

Encrypting the handling of this type of data

*Establish strong password management policies:*

Apply security systems to Point of Sale (POS) terminals

*Define clear access policies for all users:*

Define user access level and access continuity

*Protect the confidentiality of sensitive data (PII/SPII):*

Using encryption, authentication, and staff training

*Ensure data integrity:*

Validate that the data has not been manipulated or deleted
