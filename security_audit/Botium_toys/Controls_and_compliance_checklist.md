## Recommendations:

### 1. Technical and Physical Controls:
***Implement Principle of Least Privilege:***

● Limit employee access to only the resources they need for their tasks, limiting unauthorized access.

***Develop and implement Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP):***

● Enable the organization to recover quickly from critical incidents, minimizing downtime.

***Establish strong password policies:***

● Require complex passwords, with periodic renewal and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

***Separation of duties:***

● Don't concentrate all tasks on one or more employees; instead, divide them. This way, in the event of a user theft, the attacker has fewer privileges.

***Install Intrusion Detection System (IDS):***

● To detect unauthorized access

***Establish a periodic backup system:***

● Ensure availability after possible attacks or system failures.

***Adopt a password management system:***

● Reduce human errors such as forgotten passwords through a credential management system.

***Modernize legacy systems:***

● Replace manual monitoring with automated tools that detect incidents in real time.

### 2. Regulatory Compliance

***Control access to credit card information:***

● Only authorized personnel should have access

***Securing the card processing environment:***

● Encrypting the handling of this type of data

***Establish strong password management policies:***

● Apply security systems to Point of Sale (POS) terminals

***Define clear access policies for all users:***

● Define user access level and access continuity

***Protect the confidentiality of sensitive data (PII/SPII):***

● Using encryption, authentication, and staff training

***Ensure data integrity:***

● Validate that the data has not been manipulated or deleted
